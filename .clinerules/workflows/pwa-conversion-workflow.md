# PWA Conversion Workflow - spin-glow-win-it-09

This workflow guides the complete conversion of the existing React + TailwindCSS web app into a mobile-ready Progressive Web App following 2025 standards.

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify the following:

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Before we begin the PWA conversion, I need to verify the current project setup. Please confirm:

1. Is this a React application using Vite as the build tool?
2. Is TailwindCSS already configured and working?
3. Do you have the project running locally?
4. What is the current project structure (can you show me the main directories)?

This information will help me tailor the conversion process to your specific setup.</question>
<options>["Yes, all confirmed - proceed with conversion", "Let me check the setup first", "I need help with the current setup"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Phase 1: Foundational PWA Setup

### Step 1: Install PWA Dependencies

Install the required PWA plugin for Vite:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-pwa
```

Verify installation and check for any peer dependency warnings.

### Step 2: Configure Vite for PWA

Update vite.config.ts (or vite.config.js) to integrate PWA functionality:

```xml
<read_file>
<path>vite.config.ts</path>
</read_file>
```

Add PWA configuration with the following structure:

- Import VitePWA from vite-plugin-pwa
- Configure manifest properties (name, short_name, description, theme_color, background_color)
- Set up workbox options for caching strategy
- Configure icon generation and sizes
- Enable development mode for testing

### Step 3: Create PWA Icons

Create the required icon set in /public/icons/ directory:

```bash
mkdir -p public/icons
```

Generate or place the following icon sizes:

- 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512 (PNG format)
- Apple touch icon (180x180)
- Favicon.ico
- Maskable icons for Android

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>For the PWA icons, I can help you in several ways:

1. Create placeholder icons with the app name/logo text
2. Help you resize existing logos/images if you have them
3. Guide you to create professional icons using design tools

Do you have existing logo/brand assets I should use, or would you like me to create placeholder icons to get started?</question>
<options>["Create placeholder icons for now", "I have existing assets to use", "Help me design new icons"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

### Step 4: Update index.html

Modify the main HTML file to include PWA meta tags:

```xml
<read_file>
<path>public/index.html</path>
</read_file>
```

Add the following meta tags and links:

- Manifest link: `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">`
- Theme color: `<meta name="theme-color" content="#your-theme-color">`
- Viewport: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
- Apple-specific meta tags for iOS compatibility
- Apple touch icon links

## Phase 2: Service Worker & Offline Capabilities

### Step 5: Configure Service Worker Generation

Set up the service worker configuration in vite.config.ts:

```javascript
// Configure workbox options for optimal caching
workbox: {
  globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg,jpg,jpeg,gif,webp,woff,woff2}'],
  runtimeCaching: [
    {
      urlPattern: /^https:\/\/api\./,
      handler: 'NetworkFirst',
      options: {
        cacheName: 'api-cache',
        expiration: {
          maxEntries: 100,
          maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 // 24 hours
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 6: Implement Offline UI/UX Components

Create React components for PWA functionality:

**Install Prompt Component (src/components/PWA/InstallPrompt.tsx):**

- Detect PWA install capability
- Show install prompt after user engagement
- Handle install event and user choice

**Offline Indicator Component (src/components/PWA/OfflineIndicator.tsx):**

- Monitor online/offline status
- Display user-friendly offline notification
- Handle network state changes

**Service Worker Registration (src/utils/pwa.ts):**

- Register service worker
- Handle service worker updates
- Manage cache updates

### Step 7: Test Offline Functionality

Implement comprehensive offline testing:

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>I'll now test the offline functionality. This involves:

1. Building the PWA version of the app
2. Serving it locally with HTTPS (required for service workers)
3. Testing offline behavior in Chrome DevTools
4. Verifying cached assets are served correctly

Should I proceed with building and testing the offline functionality?</question>
<options>["Yes, build and test offline functionality", "Let me review the code first", "I want to test manually"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

Test scenarios:

- Initial app load and caching
- Offline navigation between cached pages
- Network recovery behavior
- Service worker update handling

## Phase 3: Enhancing the Native App Feel

### Step 8: Implement Add to Home Screen Prompt

Create an intelligent install prompt system:

```javascript
// Implement in InstallPrompt component
- Track user engagement metrics
- Show prompt after meaningful interaction
- Respect user's previous choices
- Provide clear value proposition
```

Integration points:

- Add to main app layout
- Trigger after user completes key actions
- Style to match existing TailwindCSS theme

### Step 9: Review and Enhance Responsiveness

Audit all components for mobile optimization:

```xml
<search_files>
<path>src</path>
<regex>className.*(?:w-|h-|p-|m-|text-|flex|grid)</regex>
<file_pattern>*.{tsx,jsx}</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

Focus areas:

- Touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
- Text readability on mobile
- Navigation usability
- Form input optimization
- Image and media responsiveness

### Step 10: Configure Splash Screens

Set up splash screen configuration:

```javascript
// In vite.config.ts PWA configuration
includeAssets: ['favicon.ico', 'apple-touch-icon.png', 'masked-icon.svg'],
manifest: {
  // ... other config
  splash_pages: null, // Let the plugin generate
}
```

Platform-specific splash screens:

- iOS: Automatic generation via manifest
- Android: WebAPK splash screen configuration

## Phase 4: Push Notifications with Supabase (Optional)

### Step 11: Backend Setup for Notifications

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>For push notifications, I need to know about your current backend setup:

1. Are you currently using Supabase for this project?
2. Do you want to implement push notifications now or skip this phase?
3. If implementing, what types of notifications do you want (game wins, updates, etc.)?

Push notifications require additional setup and user permissions.</question>
<options>["Implement push notifications with Supabase", "Skip notifications for now", "Use a different backend service"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

If implementing with Supabase:

- Create notifications table in Supabase
- Set up Edge Function for sending notifications
- Configure VAPID keys for web push

### Step 12: Frontend Push Notification Logic

Implement client-side push notification handling:

```javascript
// Components to create:
- NotificationPermission.tsx
- PushSubscriptionManager.ts
- NotificationHandler.ts
```

Features:

- Request user permission
- Subscribe to push notifications
- Handle incoming notifications
- Manage subscription state

### Step 13: Notification Triggers

Set up notification trigger mechanisms:

- Database triggers for game events
- Manual admin notifications
- Scheduled notifications
- User preference management

## Phase 5: Final Testing and Auditing

### Step 14: Cross-Browser and Device Testing

Comprehensive testing matrix:

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>For comprehensive testing, I'll need to verify PWA functionality across different platforms. 

Can you test on multiple devices/browsers, or should I focus on specific ones? The critical combinations are:

- Chrome on Android (primary PWA platform)
- Safari on iOS (secondary but important)
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

Which testing approach works best for your situation?</question>
<options>["Test on all major platforms", "Focus on mobile-first testing", "I'll handle device testing myself"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

Testing checklist:

- ☐ PWA installation flow on Android
- ☐ Add to Home Screen on iOS
- ☐ Offline functionality across browsers
- ☐ Responsive design on various screen sizes
- ☐ Performance on slower networks
- ☐ Service worker updates

### Step 15: Lighthouse PWA Audit

Run comprehensive Lighthouse audit:

```bash
# Install Lighthouse CLI if needed
npm install -g lighthouse

# Run PWA audit
lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --only-categories=pwa --chrome-flags="--headless"
```

Target scores:

- PWA: 90+ (required)
- Performance: 90+ (recommended)
- Accessibility: 90+ (recommended)
- Best Practices: 90+ (recommended)

Address any failing audits:

- Missing manifest properties
- Service worker issues
